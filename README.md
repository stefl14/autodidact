This project aims to create a domain specific search engine for areas
I'm interested in (neuroscience and ML to start with).

In recent years, the growth of open source Large Language Models has made it feasible to building
accurate semantic search engines without huge resources. Machine learning approaches
have also simplified the process of parsing unstructured text (e.g. from PDFs).

Combining these two advances, I'm creating a domain specific search engine for neuroscience.

The reason for this is twofold:

    1. Traditional search is great for high level answers to a query. But if you're a domain expert looking for specific and up to date information about advances in your field, "Googling" it might not be the best option. For one thing, most answers you get from Google will be based on a knowledge graph constructed using wikipedia, which naturally limits the depth and breadth of searchable information. Information is often locked away in unstructured PDFs.
